# PyQt_IDE
> Light IDE in Python with PyQt5.

## Demo
![demo](https://github.com/Intercrus/PyQt_IDE/blob/master/demo.gif)

## Features
* Only pure python and PyQt5
* Fast and light IDE

__Of course, this ide is not a competitor to PyCharm or Atom or any other serious project. But the limited functionality also has its advantages: the ide is faster, lighter, and completely transparent.__

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `ide_main.py`
> After that IDE should start

## TODO
* IDE can't read input (**ex**: `name = str(input())`). It runs the code but can't accept input. Need to fix this.
* It would be nice to add the ability to choose a theme.
* Ð¡orrect the font in the code entry field. I think can make it nicer.
* Make such a bar on the left for more convenient navigation:
