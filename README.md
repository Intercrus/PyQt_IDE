# PyQt_IDE
> Light IDE in Python with PyQt5.  
> IDE was originally conceived only for working with Python.

## Demo
![demo](https://github.com/Intercrus/PyQt_IDE/blob/master/demo.gif)

## Features
* Only pure Python and PyQt5
* Fast and light IDE

__Of course, this ide is not a competitor to PyCharm or Atom or any other serious project. But the limited functionality also has its advantages: the ide is faster, lighter, and completely transparent.__

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `ide_main.py`
> After that IDE should start

## TODO
* IDE can't read input (**ex**: `name = str(input())`). IDE runs the code but can't accept input. Need to fix this.
* It would be nice to add the ability to choose a theme.
* Ð¡orrect the font in the code entry field. I think can make it nicer.
* Make such a bar on the left for more convenient navigation:  
![](https://github.com/Intercrus/PyQt_IDE/blob/master/left_bar_navigation.png)  
* Implementing a find button to search for specific words in programs.
* Add code formatting PEP8 (**ex: atom-beautify**)
* Mini-map of a file, such as a **minimap** module to an atom or sublime.
* if possible, implement a debugger.
* and other useful features.

__I will be pleased if someone wants to participate in the development of this IDE. Unfortunately, at the moment I do not have time to deal with this project. If you have questions about the code, write to me in telegram: [@scytheofdeath](http://telegram.me/scytheofdeath)__
